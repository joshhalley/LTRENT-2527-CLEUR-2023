## Task 7: SDWAN Monitoring with webhooks

The Cisco SD-WAN platform provides webhooks that allow third-party applications to receive network data, when specified events occur.

* Webhooks enable push-model mechanism to send notifications in real-time.
* To retrieve alarms in real-time from vManage using the REST APIs, you need to poll for the data frequently.
* By using webhooks, vManage can send HTTP POST request to the external system in real-time once an alarm is received.
* Webhooks are sometimes referred to as “Reverse APIs” and you must design an API to consume or process the data that are sent via webhook.

## Step 1: Confiugre vManage

To enable webhook notifications for pushing alarms to external systems

* Goto Monitor > Logs Click on Alarm Notifications

 ![postman](/images/wh1.png)

* Click Add Alarm Notification
* Enter a Name – “webhook_test”
* Select Severity – Critical & Major
* Select Alarm Name – Control vBond State Change
* Check Webhook Check box
* Enter the webhook server URL, username, and password for webhook
* If webhook server does not have authentication configured, please provide simple username and password, that are test and test, respectively.
* Webhook URL should be set to "http://198.18.133.100:5001/"
* Webhook Threshold – 10
* Select All Devices option and click Add to complete the webhook settings

* Enable Alarm notifications in Administration settings of vManage.

## Step 2: Enable Webhook Server

Set up webhook server to accept notifications sent from vManage.

* To accept HTTP post requests sent from vManage, you need to enable HTTP web server and design API route.
* The “webhook.py” script shown below spins up flask web server listening on port 5001 for HTTP POST request.
* Defined webhook() function accepts the POST request at route "http://198.18.133.100:5001/" and extracts the data from request and prints with Indent.

```code
cat webhook.py 
```

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import json
import os
import time
import datetime
import pytz

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/',methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    if request.method == 'POST':
       print("Data received from Webhook is: ", (json.dumps(request.json, indent=4)))
       return "Webhook received!"

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)
```

## Step 3: Start Webhook Server

On ubuntu command prompt, run the command python webhook.py to spin up HTTP webhook server.

```code
python3 webhook.py 
 * Serving Flask app 'webhook'
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5001
 * Running on http://198.18.133.100:5001
Press CTRL+C to quit
```

* Trigger alarm by clearing control connections on vManage
* SSH to vManage and give the command “clear control connections”

```code
python3 webhook.py 
 * Serving Flask app 'webhook-1'
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)

```
